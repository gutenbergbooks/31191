<h2><a name="A_LETTER_c" id="A_LETTER_c"></a>A LETTER, &amp;c.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>;&mdash;</p>

<p>An English courtier procured a colonial judgeship for a
young dependant wholly ignorant of law. The new functionary,
on parting with his patron, received from him the
following sage advice,&mdash;"Be careful never to assign reasons,
for whether your judgments be right or wrong, your
reasons will certainly be bad." You have cause to regret
that some friend had not been equally provident of your
reputation, and intimated that it was only expected of you
to vote for Mr. Webster's measures, but by no means to assist
him in vindicating them. You did, indeed, vote precisely
as those who procured your nomination intended
you should; yet, on your return home, you found your
name had become a byword and a reproach in your native
State. Another election approached, but you declined submitting
your recent course to the judgment of the electors,
and withdrew from the canvass. But although the people
were thus prevented from voting against you, they persisted
in speaking and writing against you. Anxious to
relieve yourself from the load of obloquy by which you
were oppressed, in an evil hour you rashly appealed to the
public through the columns of a newspaper, and gave the
"reasons" of your vote for the Fugitive Slave Law. You
had a high and recent example of the kind of logic suited
to your case. You might have indulged in transcendental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
nonsense, and talked about the climate, soil, and scenery
of New England and the wonders of physical geography,
and, assuming that negroes were created free, you might
have contended that, in voting for a law to catch and enslave
them, you had avoided the folly of re&euml;nacting the
law of God. Reasons of this sort, you and others had declared,
"had convinced the understanding and touched the
conscience of the nation." Instead of following an example
so illustrious and successful, you assign "reasons"
so very commonplace, that the most ordinary capacity can
understand them, and so feeble, that the slightest strength
can overthrow them.</p>

<p>Your first "reason" is, that the delivery of fugitives is
a constitutional obligation. By this you mean, that, by
virtue of the construction of a certain clause in the Constitution
by the Supreme Court, Congress has the power to
pass a law for the recovery of fugitive slaves. Well, Sir,
does this constitutional obligation authorize Congress to
pass <i>any</i> law whatsoever on the subject, however atrocious
and wicked? Had you voted for a law to prevent smuggling,
in which you had authorized every tide-waiter to
shoot any person suspected of having contraband goods
in his possession, would it have been a good "reason" for
such an atrocity, that the collection of duties was "a constitutional
obligation"? You are condemned for voting
for an arbitrary, detestable, diabolical law,&mdash;one that tramples
upon the rights of conscience, outrages the feelings
of humanity, discards the rules of evidence, levels all the
barriers erected by the common law for the protection of
personal liberty, and, in defiance of the Constitution, and
against its express provisions, gives to the courts the appointment
of legions of slave-catching judges. And your
"reason" for all this is, that the delivery of fugitives is
"a constitutional obligation"! The "obligation" is not
in issue. Please to understand, Sir, that it is not denied.
It is for the <i>manner</i> in which you profess to have discharged
the obligation that you are censured, and be it re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>membered,
that not one of the obnoxious provisions of your
law is required by the Constitution. You go on and attempt
to enlighten your constituents as to the history of this
constitutional obligation. As the obligation affords you no
apology for the iniquitous features of your law, its history
is, of course, mere surplusage, and serves no other purpose
than to divert the attention of your readers from yourself.
About two thirds of your apology is occupied with an historical
disquisition, which has as much to do with your
vindication as the question respecting the existence of a
lunar atmosphere. I will not, however, withhold from you
whatever benefit you may derive from either your logic or
your history, but will give each a fair and honest examination.
You inform the public that, at the time the Constitution
was formed,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Slavery had been abolished in some of the States, and still
existed in others. Here seemed an insurmountable incompatibility
of interests, and nothing perplexed the wise men of that day&mdash;and
they were <i>very</i> wise men&mdash;so much as this topic. At
last they agreed that the new Constitution should have nothing to do
with it; that the word <i>slavery</i> should not be mentioned in it, and
that it should be left to the States themselves to establish, retain, or
abolish it, just as much after the adoption of the Constitution as before.
But in order to secure the existence of the institution to
those States who preferred it, it was agreed that the persons escaping
from labor to which they were bound, in one commonwealth,
and found in another, should be returned to the State from which
they had fled. The provision was necessary for the preservation
of this interest <i>in statu quo</i>. It did not extend slavery. It kept it
where it already was, and where it could not have continued if
every slave who escaped North was at once free and irreclaimable.
The members of the confederacy from the South saw this distinctly,
and <i>deliberately declared</i> that they could not and would not enter
a union with States who would tempt away their slaves with the
prospect of immediate and permanent freedom.... The Constitution
was adopted with this provision, and it could not have been
adopted without it."</p></div>

<p>Thus we learn from you, Sir, that when the Constitution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
was formed, "slavery had been abolished in some of the
States." It is a pity you did not vouchsafe to tell us
which of the States had thus early and honorably distinguished
themselves. Of the thirteen American States in
1787, how many, Sir, had <i>by law</i> abolished slavery? <span class="smcap">Not
one.</span> Your "some States" consisted of <span class="smcap">Massachusetts</span>
alone. And how was slavery abolished there? Not by
any express prohibition in her constitution, nor by any act
of her legislature. Fortunately, her constitution, like that
of most other States, contained a general declaration of human
rights, somewhat similar to the "rhetorical abstraction"
in the Declaration of Independence. Two or three
years before the Federal Convention assembled, a young
lawyer, perceiving that the declaration in the constitution
had inadvertently made no exclusion of the rights of men
with dark complexions, brought an action for a slave
against his master for work done and performed. An upright
and independent court, not having the fear of our
Southern brethren before their eyes, decided that the slave
was a <span class="smcap">MAN</span>, and therefore entitled to the rights which the
constitution declared belonged to <i>all</i> men, and gave judgment
for the plaintiff. In this way, Sir, was slavery abolished
in Massachusetts, and hence the delegates from Massachusetts
in the Convention were the only ones who
represented a <i>free</i> State. And now, Sir, what becomes of
your "insurmountable incompatibility of interests" arising
from the fact that "slavery had been abolished in some
States and still existed in others," which you tell us so much
perplexed the wise men of that day? We shall see, Sir,
that on questions touching human bondage the Massachusetts
delegation seem to have been slaveholders in heart,
and did not partake of the perplexity which troubled the
wise men. With the exception of that delegation, there
were not probably half a dozen members of the convention
who were not slaveholders.</p>

<p>It would seem from your historical review, that the
clause in the Constitution respecting fugitive slaves was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the grand compromise between the North and the South,
without which "the Constitution could not have been
adopted"; and that to this clause we owe our glorious
slave-catching Union. You fortify this wonderful historical
discovery by appealing to the "deliberate declarations"
of Southern members, that they "would not enter a union
with States who would tempt away their slaves," &amp;c. It
is to be regretted that you have not deemed it expedient to
refer to the records of these declarations, as other students
of our constitutional history are wholly ignorant of them.
Suffer me, Sir, to enter into a few historical details, for the
purpose of vindicating the liberty I take to differ with you
as to the accuracy of your statements.</p>

<p>The Convention met in Philadelphia, 25th May, 1787.
On the 29th of the same month, Mr. Randolph, of Virginia,
submitted a plan of government. It contained no
allusion to fugitive slaves. On the same day, Mr. Charles
Pinckney, of South Carolina, submitted another plan.
This last provided for the surrender of fugitive criminals,
but was silent about fugitive slaves. On the 15th of June,
Mr. Patterson, of New Jersey, submitted a third plan.
This also provided for the surrender of fugitives from
justice, but not from bondage. On the 18th, Mr. Hamilton
announced his plan, but the fugitive slave found no place
in it. On the 26th of June, the Convention, having agreed
on the general features of the proposed Constitution in the
form of resolutions, referred them to "a committee of detail,"
for the purpose of reducing them to the form of a
Constitution. In these resolutions, there was not the most
distant allusion to fugitive slaves. On the 6th of August,
the committee reported the draft of a Constitution, and yet,
strange as you may deem it, the provision without which,
you tell us, the Constitution could not have been adopted,
was not in it, although there was in it a provision for the
surrender of fugitive criminals. For three months had the
Convention been in session, and not one syllable had been
uttered about fugitive slaves. At last, on the 29th of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
August, as we learn from the minutes, "It was moved
and seconded to agree to the following proposition, to be
inserted after the 15th article: 'If any person, bound to
service or labor in any of the United States, shall escape
into another State, he or she shall not be discharged from
such service or labor in consequence of any regulation subsisting
in the State to which they escape, but shall be
delivered up to the person justly claiming their service or
labor,' <i>which passed unanimously</i>." Really, Sir, I find in
this record but little evidence of the perplexity which distressed
our wise men, or of the great compromise between
the North and South, on which you dwell. The 15th
article, referred to above, was the article providing for the
surrender of fugitives from justice, and this suggested the
idea, that it would be well to provide, also, for the surrender
of fugitive slaves. In an assembly consisting almost
exclusively of slaveholders, the idea was exceedingly relished;
and without a word of opposition, the suggestion
was unanimously adopted. From Mr. Madison's report
we learn that, the day before, Messrs. Butler and Pinckney
had informally proposed that fugitive slaves and servants
should be delivered up "like criminals." "Mr. Wilson [of
Penn.]. This would oblige the Executive of the State to do
it at the public expense. Mr. Sherman [of Conn.] saw no
more propriety in the public seizing and surrendering a slave
or servant than a horse." (<i>Madison Papers</i>, p. 1447.)
The subject was here dropped. The next day the motion
was made in form, and, as Mr. Madison says, "agreed to,
<i>nem. con.</i>" From the phraseology of the motion, and
the objections of Messrs. Wilson and Sherman, it was perfectly
understood that the obligation of delivery was imposed
on the States, and that no power was intended to be
conferred on Congress to legislate on the subject. Messrs.
Wilson and Sherman's objections arose from no moral
repugnance to slave-catching, but from the inconvenience
they apprehended the <i>State</i> authorities would be subjected
to; and Mr. Wilson perhaps spoke from experience, as his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
own State had at that very time a law for catching and
returning fugitive slaves from other States. The idea,
therefore, that this agreement was a <i>compromise</i> between
the North and South is wholly imaginary, and you, Sir,
must have mistaken some recent fulminations from the
Southern chivalry for the "deliberate declarations" which
you suppose were made in the Convention. Believe me,
Sir, no members of the Convention ever declared they
would not enter into the Union, unless it was agreed to
surrender fugitive slaves, for the obvious reason, that the
Northern slaveholders required no threats from their
Southern brethren to consent to a compact convenient to
both. It is very true, Sir, that there were compromises,
and that there were "deliberate declarations," but they
had no reference to the surrender of runaway slaves. I
have pointed out your historical mistake, not because it
has the remotest bearing on your justification, but because
you seem to think that it has.</p>

<p>The first great compromise was between, not the North
and the South, but the small and the large States. The
one claimed, and the other refused, an equality of suffrage
in the national legislature. It was at last agreed, that the
suffrage should be equal in one house, and according to
population in the other. This was the first compromise.
Then came the question, What should constitute the representative
population? The Southern States had more
slaves than the Northern, and the former insisted that
slaves should be included in the representative population.
This would have given the Southern States an unfair
preponderance in Congress. Moreover, a portion of the
Southern States were engaged in the African slave-trade,
and, of course, every slave landed on their shores would
increase their political power in Congress. To reconcile
the North to slave representation, it was offered that <i>direct
taxation</i> should be proportioned to representation. But the
North was reluctant, and, as usual, was bullied into a compromise.
Mr. Davie, of North Carolina, made a "deliberate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
declaration":&mdash;"He was sure that North Carolina would
never confederate on any terms that did not rate them (the
slaves) at least as three fifths. If the Eastern States meant,
therefore, to exclude them (the slaves) altogether, the business
was at an end." (<i>Madison Papers</i>, p. 1081.) This
threat, and others like it, settled the matter. The compromise,
of three fifths of the slaves to be included in the
representative population, was accepted on the motion of <i>a
New England member</i>; and the consequence is, that the
slave States have now twenty-one members in the lower
house of Congress more than they are entitled to by their
free population. This was the second compromise. There
was still a third, far more wicked and detestable, and effected
by the "deliberate declarations" of Southern members.
The "committee of detail" has been already mentioned.
It consisted of Messrs. Rutledge of South Carolina,
Randolph of Virginia, Wilson of Pennsylvania, Ellsworth of
Connecticut, and Gorham of Massachusetts. This committee,
it will be recollected, were to reduce to the <i>form</i>
of a Constitution the resolutions agreed on by the Convention.
Neither in the resolutions themselves, nor in the
discussions which preceded their adoption, had any reference
been made to a guarantee for the continuance of the
African slave-trade. Nevertheless, this committee, of their
own will and pleasure, inserted in their draft the following
clause:&mdash;"No tax or duty shall be laid by the legislature
on articles exported from any State, <i>nor on the migration
or importation of such persons as the several States shall
think proper to admit, nor shall such migration or importation
be prohibited</i>." To understand the cunning wickedness
of this clause, it must be recollected that Congress
was to have power to regulate foreign commerce, and commerce
between the States; and hence it might, at a future
time, suppress both the foreign and domestic commerce in
human flesh, or it might burden this commerce with duties.
Hence this artfully expressed perpetual restriction on
the power of Congress to interfere with the traffic in human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
beings. As this grand scheme was concocted in the committee,
and not in the Convention, it may be interesting to
inquire into its paternity.</p>

<p>In the debates which ensued on this clause, Mr. Ellsworth,
one of the committee who reported it, "was for
leaving the clause as it now stands. <i>Let every State import
what it pleases.</i> The morality or wisdom of slavery
are considerations belonging to the States themselves.
<i>What enriches a part enriches the whole</i>, and the States
are the best judges of their particular interests. The old
Confederation had not <i>meddled</i> with this point, and he did
not see any greater necessity for bringing it within the
policy of the new one." "As slaves multiply so fast in
Virginia and Maryland that it is <i>cheaper</i> to raise than to
import them, whilst in the <i>sickly</i> rice-swamps foreign supplies
are <i>necessary</i>, if we go no farther than is urged [a
proposal to permit the trade for a limited time], we shall
be unjust towards South Carolina and Georgia. Let us not
intermeddle." (<i>Madison Papers</i>, pp. 1389, 1391.) This
gentleman was one of your "very wise men"; and his
mantle has recently fallen upon other wise men from the
East. Mr. Wilson, another member of the committee, objected.
"All articles imported," said he, "are to be taxed;
slaves alone are exempt. This is, in fact, a bounty on
that article." The clause was referred to another committee,
who modified it, by limiting the restriction to 1800.
It was moved to guarantee the slave-trade for twenty
years, by postponing the restriction to 1808. This motion
was <i>seconded</i> by Mr. Gorham, another member of
the committee. Mr. Randolph, also of the committee,
was against the slave-trade, and opposed to any restriction
on the power of Congress to suppress it. Two of
the committee, then, we find, were against the trade,
and three, Messrs. Rutledge, Ellsworth, and Gorham, for
perpetuating it. And now, Sir, what were the inducements
which prevailed on the two wise men from the
East to yield their consent to a proposition so wicked and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
abominable? We are, of course, not informed what passed
in the committee, but we can well imagine, from the language
used by the chairman and others in the Convention.
Said Mr. Rutledge, "If the Convention thinks North Carolina,
South Carolina, and Georgia will ever agree to this
plan [the Federal Constitution] unless their right to import
slaves be untouched, the expectation is <span class="smcap">VAIN</span>. The people
of those States will never be such fools as to give up so
important an interest." In other words, "Gentlemen of
the North, no Union without the African slave-trade."
Said Mr. Charles Pinckney, "South Carolina can never receive
the plan [of the Constitution] if it prohibits the slave-trade.
In every proposed extension of the powers of Congress,
that State has expressly and watchfully excepted
that of meddling with the importation of negroes." (<i>Madison
Papers</i>, p. 1389.) Mr. Charles C. Pinckney "thought
himself bound to declare candidly, that he did not think
South Carolina would stop her importations of slaves in
any short time." Thus you see, Sir, that the "deliberate
declarations" to which you allude were made in reference
to the continuance of the African slave-trade, and not, as
you suppose, to the catching of fugitive slaves. Two New
England gentlemen of the committee yielded to these declarations,
and sacrificed conscience and humanity for the
sake of the Union, and the consideration that what enriched
a part enriched the whole. Happily, in this case, Southern
bluster was met by Southern bluster, and it is owing to
Virginia, and not to the virtue and independence of New
England, that the Constitution was rescued from the infamy
of granting a solemn and perpetual guarantee to an accursed
commerce.</p>

<p>In Virginia, the slaves, as Mr. Ellsworth remarked, multiplied
so fast, that it was <i>cheaper</i> to raise than import them.
She was then, as now, a breeding State for the Southern
markets. Hence, her delegates were as ready to bluster for
protection, as the South Carolina delegates were for a free
trade in men and women. Of course, the <i>motives</i> assigned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
were patriotic, not selfish. Mr. Randolph "could never
agree to the clause as it stands. He would sooner <span class="smcap">risk
the Constitution</span>." (<i>Madison Papers</i>, p. 1396.) Mr.
Madison would not consent to the continuance of the traffic
till 1808. "Twenty years will produce all the mischief
that can be apprehended from the liberty to import slaves.
So long a term will be more dishonorable to the American
character, than to say nothing about it in the Constitution."
(<i>Madison Papers</i>, p. 1427.) Mr. Mason from Virginia denounced
the traffic as "infernal." (<i>Madison Papers</i>, p.
1390.) The result of all these threats on each side was, as
usual, a compromise, by which Congress was prohibited
from suppressing the foreign and internal commerce in slaves
for twenty years, and was left at liberty to do as it might
see fit, after that period. After twenty years the foreign
trade was suppressed, and North and South Carolina and
Georgia remained in the Union! Virginia, as well as the
other Slave States, is greatly interested in the home slave-trade,
and that has <i>not</i> been suppressed, although Congress
has full power over it.</p>

<p>It does not appear from Mr. Madison's report what reply
was made in the Convention to the Virginia objections,
but in his speech in the Convention of his own State, he
tells us,&mdash;"The gentlemen from South Carolina and Georgia
argued in this manner: We have now liberty to import
this species of property, and much of the property now
possessed had been purchased or otherwise acquired in
contemplation of improving it by the assistance of imported
slaves. What would be the consequence of hindering
us in this point? The <i>slaves</i> of Virginia would rise
in value, and we should be obliged to go to your markets."
(<i>Elliott's Debates</i>, III. 454.) Certainly, Sir, these South
Carolina and Georgia delegates were "very wise men,"
and their predictions are now history, and the planters of
Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana buy
slaves of the Virginia breeders. But what shall I say of
the wise men from the East? This horrible compromise,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
this guarantee of the African slave-trade for twenty years,
was carried by the votes of the Massachusetts and Connecticut
delegates, and would have been defeated, had
they had the courage and virtue to have voted against it.</p>

<p>I have indulged in this long digression, to show that the
clause in the Constitution respecting fugitive slaves was
not, as you represent it, the great compromise of the Constitution,
the key-stone of the Union, and that our slaveholding
fathers were not, as you suppose, greatly perplexed,
nor their consciences deeply wounded, by the existence
of slavery in all the States of the confederacy with
one exception. Having disposed of your history, I return
to your logic.</p>

<p>Whether the constitutional injunction to surrender fugitive
slaves was a compromise or not, is of no practical importance.
The clause speaks for itself, and prescribes no
mode by which the title of the claimant shall be ascertained,
while it expressly implies that the title shall be established
before the surrender is made. Hence, the fair presumption
is, that the title to a <span class="smcap">MAN</span> shall be proved, with at least as
much certainty and formality as the title to a horse. Had
you, Sir, in your law, provided that a Virginian shall not
come to Boston, and there seize and carry off a husband,
wife, or child but by the same process, and on as strong
evidence, as he may now seize and carry off a horse which
you claim as your own, instead of finding your name a
byword and a reproach, you would have been honored and
applauded by your fellow-citizens, and returned to Congress
by a triumphant vote; nor is there a syllable in the Constitution
which prohibits or discountenances such a mode of
deciding the title to a human being. It is in vain, then,
Sir, that you plead your "constitutional obligation" in justification
of your most detestable law. But, as if one
wrong could justify another, you plead in your excuse the
law of 1793, and you ask in your simplicity of those who
condemn your law if they do not perceive that they are
"denouncing their fathers." Well, Sir, were our fathers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
infallible? Pity it is, Sir, that you were not on the floor
of Congress when that body declared the African slave-trade
to be <span class="smcap">PIRACY</span>. You might then, Sir, have risen in
your place, and inquired, "Do you not perceive that you
are denouncing your fathers, who were very wise men, and
who guaranteed for twenty years the very traffic which
you now proclaim to be piracy?" Pity it is, Sir, that
you did not stand by the side of your patron on Plymouth
Rock, and whisper in his ear, "Do you not perceive that
you are denouncing our fathers?" when he declared, "In
the sight of our law the African slave-trader is a <span class="smcap">PIRATE</span>
and a <span class="smcap">FELON</span>, and in the sight of Heaven an offender beyond
the ordinary depth of human guilt." Mr. Webster
is better versed in constitutional history than you are, and
he well knew that some of our fathers "deliberately declared
they would not enter a Union" in which they were
to be debarred from pursuing this piratical, felonious, guilty
traffic. Our fathers were mostly slaveholders, and yet you,
Sir, unconsciously denounce both their morality and intelligence,
when you affirm the institution of slavery to be
"wrong and unwise." And yet all who presume to find
fault with your cruel, unjust, wicked law are guilty forsooth
of denouncing their fathers!</p>

<p>You tell us that the Convention of 1787 "<i>agreed that
the new Constitution should have nothing to do with slavery</i>."
I have not been so fortunate as to find the record of
this agreement, but if such a compact was indeed made,
then seldom, if ever, has a solemn covenant been more
grossly and wickedly violated. Is it, Sir, in virtue of this
agreement, that you voted to fine and imprison every conscientious,
humane citizen who may refuse, at the command
of a minion of a commissioner, to join in a slave
hunt? Did this agreement confer on the holders of slaves
an enlarged representation in Congress? Was it in pursuance
of this agreement that the importation of slaves was
guaranteed for twenty years? Did this agreement authorize
the Federal government to enter into negotiations with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Great Britain and Mexico for a mutual surrender of runaway
slaves? Was it in pursuance of this same agreement,
that our government negotiated with Russia and Spain to
prevent emancipation in Cuba,&mdash;a traitorous conspiracy
with despots against the rights of man? How, Sir, was
this agreement illustrated, when Daniel Webster, as Secretary
of State under John Tyler of glorious memory, made a
demand on Great Britain for the surrender of the slaves of
the Creole, who had gallantly achieved their liberty, and
taken refuge in the West Indies? How comes it, Sir, that
under this agreement an act of Congress secures to the
Slave States officers in the navy in proportion to the number
of their slaves? How is it, that under this agreement
colored men are seized in the District of Columbia, under
"the exclusive jurisdiction" of the Federal government on
the <i>suspicion</i> of being slaves, and, when that suspicion is
rebutted by the non-appearance of any claimant, are sold
as slaves for life, to pay their jail-fees? Perhaps it would
be denouncing our fathers, to say that Messrs. Webster and
Cass may search the archives of Austria in vain for any act
so utterly diabolical as this, perpetrated by a government
which it was agreed "should have nothing to do with slavery."
Was it to carry out this famous agreement that
the Federal government officially declared through its
Secretary, Mr. Calhoun, that Texas was annexed to preserve
the institution of slavery from the perils that threatened
it?</p>

<p>Once more, Sir. We all know that the slaveholders regard
the free blacks as dangerous to the subordination of
their slaves, and are contemplating their forcible removal.
Think you, Sir, Mr. Webster was mindful of the agreement
you have discovered, when, on the 7th of last March,
in his place in the Senate, he proposed his magnificent
scheme of taxing the whole nation untold millions to give
additional security to property in human beings? "If,"
said the Massachusetts Senator, "any gentleman from the
<i>South</i> shall propose a scheme of colonization to be carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
on by <i>this government</i> upon a large scale, for the transportation
of free colored people to any colony or <i>any place in
the world</i>, I should be quite disposed to incur almost any
degree of expense to accomplish the object." The magnitude
of the scheme, and the cost at which it is to be accomplished,
are thus hinted:&mdash;"There have been received
into the treasury of the United States <span class="smcap">EIGHTY MILLIONS</span> of
dollars, the proceeds of the sales of the public lands ceded
by Virginia. If the residue should be sold at the same
rate, the whole aggregate will exceed <span class="smcap">TWO HUNDRED MILLIONS</span>
of dollars. If <i>Virginia and the South</i> see fit to
adopt any proposition to <i>relieve</i> themselves from the free
people of color among them, they have my free consent
that the <i>government</i> shall pay <i>them</i> any sum of money out
of the proceeds which may be adequate for the purpose."
Will you, Sir, please to point out the article of the agreement
of 1787, which, while it restricts Congress from having
any thing to do with slavery, sanctions an appropriation
not exceeding two hundred millions of dollars, for the purpose
of strengthening the institution of slavery, by <i>relieving</i>
the slaveholders from the presence of free people of
color, and forcibly transporting to any place in the world
hundreds of thousands of native-born Americans, who have
as good a constitutional right to the pursuit of life, liberty,
and happiness on their native soil, as Mr. Webster himself?
Mr. Webster, it seems, now views the subject of negro colonization
in precisely the same light that he did thirty
years since, although his <i>intentions</i> on this, as on various
other points, have undergone marvellous changes. We
learn from a Massachusetts paper (<i>Congregationalist</i>, 6
July, 1849), that this gentleman was in 1822 appointed by
a public meeting to draft a constitution for the State Colonization
Society. After considerable discussion in the committee
he rose and said, "I must leave. I understand the
whole project. It is a scheme of the slaveholders to get
rid of their free negroes. I will have nothing to do with
it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>And how, Sir, as a member of Congress, have <i>you</i> fulfilled
this agreement to have nothing to do with slavery?
Not only have you required "good citizens," when commanded,
to hunt and catch slaves, but you have even fixed
a money value on every slave. If a master fails to recover
his fugitive slave through the agency, "direct or indirect,"
of any citizen, you give him an action for damages. In
all other cases of trespass, the damages sustained by the
plaintiff are assessed by a jury according to the evidence.
You kindly save the master the trouble of proving the
value of his lost property, and give him out of the pockets
of the defendant $1,000, no matter whether the slave was
sick or well, young or old. If a woman escapes with a
child at the breast, the master is to have $2,000! Recollect,
Sir, this is for <i>damages</i> to the slaveholder; the trespasser
is to pay to the government, which was to have nothing
to do with slavery, another thousand dollars, and to be incarcerated
six months. Either, Sir, you have wholly mistaken
the nature of the "agreement," or the slaveholders,
through the aid of their Northern auxiliaries, have, in defiance
of the agreement, rendered the Federal government a
mighty engine in protecting, extending, and perpetuating
the stupendous iniquity of human bondage.</p>

<p>Your first excuse for voting for the recent slave-catching
law, after relying on your "constitutional obligation," is,
that it is "<i>practically more favorable to the fugitive than
the law of 1793</i>"!!! The Southern lawyers, then, who
drafted the bill, were a set of blunderers, and your constituents
are blockheads for blaming you for legislating against
human rights, when, in fact, you were loosening the bonds
of the oppressed, and facilitating escape from the prison-house.
Your assertion may well excite astonishment at
the South as well as the North, till your <i>proof</i> is known,
and then, indeed, astonishment will be exchanged for ridicule.
You tell us, "the <i>evidence</i> of such an assertion may
be found in the fact, that by the old law every magistrate
in Massachusetts, amounting to several hundreds, and so in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the other States, were authorized and required to cause the
arrest of any fugitive, examine into his case, and deliver
him to the claimant, if he was proved to be a slave; while
under the new law that power is <i>limited</i> to the justices of
the United States' courts, and to the commissioners appointed
by them, not exceeding, perhaps, on an average,
six or eight persons in each State." So it seems the slave-catchers
had formerly no difficulty in finding a magistrate
among hundreds to aid them, but that now, before they
hunt a slave, they must hunt and catch a United States
judge, or a commissioner of six or eight in a whole State.
Truly a hard case, and yet the slaveholders themselves set
the very trap in which they have been caught, and thus it
is that, through their folly, and your generosity in not
pointing out to them the blunder they were committing,
the new law is more favorable to the fugitive than the
old one. Surely, Sir, it could not have been more perilous
to the young West Indian judge to meddle with "reasons,"
than it is for you. Either, Sir, you voted for the law
without reading it, or you have forgotten its provision. Be
assured, the Southern lawyers were as well acquainted as
yourself with the fact, that a few individuals, termed
"commissioners," had been appointed by the United States
courts to perform certain ministerial acts; and that, as these
men were now to be promoted to the office of slave-catching
judges, they would be wholly inadequate in number to
lend efficient aid to the hunters of men. Hence, they inserted
in the third section of the bill, the following enactment,
which has strangely escaped your recollection, viz.:&mdash;"And
it is further enacted, that the Circuit Courts
of the United States, and the Superior Courts of <i>each</i> organized
Territory of the United States, <span class="smcap">SHALL</span> from time to
time <span class="smcap">ENLARGE THE NUMBER OF COMMISSIONERS</span> with a view
to afford reasonable facilities to reclaim fugitives from labor,
and to the prompt discharge of the duties imposed by this
act." So that, instead of six or eight commissioners in a
State, we are to have as many hundreds, if needed. Nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
is this all. By the second section, the power possessed by
the Circuit Courts to appoint commissioners is for the first
time conferred on the <i>Territorial</i> courts, so that there shall
be no lack of slave-catching judges in Oregon, Utah, and
New Mexico. Instead of your six or eight commissioners
in a State, your law contemplates that there shall be one or
more in <i>each county</i>; for the fifth section provides, that,
"the better to enable the said commissioners to execute
their duties faithfully and efficiently, ... they are hereby
authorized and empowered, within their <i>counties respectively</i>,"
to appoint one or more persons to execute their
warrants. So it seems we are to have an unlimited number
of judges and executioners. These executioners, expressly
appointed to catch slaves, and of course among the
most worthless and degraded of the community, are one
and all invested with the power of a high sheriff to call
out the <i>posse comitatus</i>, not merely in his own county, but
in every hamlet in the State, and require "good citizens,"
under pain of fine and imprisonment, to join him in his execrable
hunt. Really, Sir, your "evidence" that the new
law is more favorable to the fugitive than the old one falls
short of demonstration.</p>

<p>You thus apologize for not giving the alleged fugitive a
trial by jury. "There was no more trial by jury provided
for under the old law than under the new law. The claim
of a jury trial is entirely <i>new</i>; never thought of till modern
discussions of the subject begun. For fifty-seven years our
fathers and we have been living under the laws which provided
no such thing, and now one which makes no such
provision is denounced in unmeasured terms as cruel and
inhuman. Where have we all been living for half a century?"
Surely, Sir, it is a most logical reason for not
changing a wicked law, that it has been in force for fifty-seven
years. Strange that the legislators of Massachusetts
did not perceive the force of this reasoning when they
abolished the laws for hanging witches and whipping
Quakers. Permit me, Sir, to ask, Where had <i>you</i> been liv<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>ing
when <i>you</i> declared it to be the <i>duty</i> of Congress to give
the fugitive a trial by jury, although for fifty-seven years
such a trial had been denied him? You probably forgot,
Sir, when giving the above "reason," that, not long before
you took your seat in Congress, you had, as a member of
the Massachusetts Legislature, voted for the following resolution,
viz.:&mdash;"We hold it to be the duty of that body
[Congress] to pass such laws only in regard thereto as will
be maintained by the public sentiment of the free States,
where such laws are to be enforced, and which shall especially
secure all persons, whose surrender may be claimed
as having escaped from labor and service in other States,
the right of having the validity of such claim determined
by a jury in the State where such claim is made." So it
seems that, while in Boston, you esteemed it the <i>especial
duty</i> of Congress to grant the fugitive a trial by jury, but
that in the atmosphere of Washington you acquired new
views of moral philosophy.</p>

<p>Suffer me, Sir, also to inquire, Where had Mr. Webster
been "living for half a century," when, on the 3d of last
June, he introduced into the Senate a bill amendatory of
the act of 1793, granting the alleged fugitive a trial by
jury whenever he shall make oath that he is not the slave
of the claimant?</p>

<p>Another of your "reasons" is, that your law does <i>not</i>
suspend the <i>habeas corpus</i>, and in proof of its innocence in
this respect, you refer to the opinion of "legal authority of
the highest kind," viz. Mr. Crittenden, of Kentucky. It
is very true that the words <i>habeas corpus</i> are omitted in
your law, as the word <i>slave</i> is in the Constitution, but in
neither case is the omission of any practical importance.
You must be aware, Sir, that whenever a person is in the
custody of another, if sufficient ground be shown to render
it probable that the custody is illegal, the writ is granted
as a matter of right. But why is it granted? That the
court may at its discretion, according to circumstances, remand
or discharge the prisoner. Take away from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
court the discretionary power to discharge, and the writ is
rendered an idle form. Your law, you say, does not suspend
the <i>habeas corpus</i>; it is guiltless of such an enormity.
A man who is carrying off one of our citizens in chains,
may indeed be served with the writ, and he brings his
prisoner before the court, and he produces a paper for
which he paid $10, and reads from your law, that this
paper, called a certificate, "shall be conclusive," and "shall
prevent all molestation of said person or persons by any
<i>process</i> issued by any court, judge, or magistrate, or other
person whomsoever." It is because the word <i>process</i>, instead
of <i>habeas corpus</i>, is used, that your law does not suspend
the writ of freedom! In vain may the prisoner plead
that he is not the person mentioned in the certificate; in
vain may he offer to show that the certificate is a forgery;
in vain may he urge that the man who signed the certificate
was not a commissioner. The little piece of paper
costing ten dollars is to save the slave-catcher from "all
molestation," not because the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> is suspended,&mdash;O,
no! but in consequence of the words "any
process"!</p>

<p>You refer to two objections, which you say are made to
your law, and endeavour to refute them; viz. the onerous
obligations imposed upon the marshal, and the penalties
attached to an attempt "to assist in the rescue of the slave
after he has been proved to be such." You have evinced
your discretion in confining yourself to only four objections
made to your law; viz. the denial of a jury trial, the suspension
of the <i>habeas corpus</i>, the duties of the marshal,
and the penalties imposed on an attempt to rescue the slave
<i>after</i> judgment. With what success, and with what "reasons,"
you have combated the first two has already been
seen. As to the last two, they scarcely merit an answer,
and hence you have selected them. If the obligations of
the marshal are onerous, he has voluntarily assumed them
by accepting the office. If, in a civilized country, a man
attempts forcibly to rescue a prisoner in the custody of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
law, he must expect to be punished. There are many
weighty objections to your law which you have not
thought it expedient to notice. Permit me to supply your
omission, and to tell you why your law is so intensely odious.
And here let me again remind you of the true issue
between you and the people. It is not now the constitutional
power of Congress under the decision of the Supreme
Court to pass a law for the recovery of fugitive slaves,&mdash;this
is conceded. The odium you have experienced,
and against which you have appealed to the public, is
caused by your having voted for a law which, in its details,
violates the Constitution, and outrages justice and humanity.
Throughout your long and labored apology, you avoid
grappling with these charges. You vindicate the denial of
a jury trial only on the ground that it has been denied for
fifty-seven years, and on the authority of Mr. Crittenden
affirm that the <i>habeas corpus</i> is not suspended; but you
avoid the constitutional and moral objections urged against
your law.</p>

<p>By the Constitution, fugitive slaves are to be restored to
those, and those only, who are legally entitled to their services.
The means of ascertaining whether a man is a
slave, whether he has fled from his master, and whether
the claimant is legally entitled to him, are not defined by
the Constitution. It is now intrusted to the discretion of
Congress to specify these means, but of course that discretion
ought to be exercised in accordance with the Constitution,
with justice, and with humanity. The complaint
against you is, that you have voted for a law which outrages
them all, and against this complaint you have failed
to offer the shadow of a vindication.</p>

<p>A Virginian comes to Boston, and there seizes one of the
inhabitants as his slave. The man claimed declares the
claim to be false and fraudulent. Here, then, is an issue
both of law and of fact between two men equally entitled
to the protection of law; for the man claimed is on every
presumption of law and justice to be regarded as free, till<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the contrary is proved. The issue between these two men
is, I have said, one of fact and of law. Is the person
seized the man he is said to be? This is a question of
fact. Admitting his identity, is he a slave, and, if so, does
he belong to the claimant? These are both questions of
law, resting upon facts to be proved. Those familiar with
the reports of Southern courts know that the title to slaves
is a frequent matter of litigation, involving intricate questions
respecting the validity of wills, the construction of
deeds, the partition of estates, and the claims of creditors.
By carrying a slave into a free State, the owner forfeits his
title to him while there, and cannot reclaim him; and
hence the acts of the claimant himself may be involved in
the issue. And now, Sir, I ask, have you ever known, or
can you conceive of, any issue at law respecting the title
to property so awfully momentous to a defendant as the
one we are considering? Were your son or daughter the
defendant in such an issue, would you not rejoice to purchase
a favorable judgment by the contribution of the last
cent of your great wealth? Let us, then, proceed to inquire
what provision <i>you</i>, in the fear of God and the love
of justice and humanity, have made for the trial of this
tremendous issue,&mdash;an issue on the result of which all the
hopes of a fellow-man for the life that is, and for that which
is to come, are suspended.</p>

<p>In the first place, What is the pecuniary value of the
plaintiff's claim to <i>himself</i>?&mdash;for it would be an insult to
humanity to estimate in dollars and cents the blessings of
liberty and of the conjugal and parental relations to the
unhappy defendant. You have yourself fixed the value
of the plaintiff's claim at <i>one thousand dollars</i>. So far,
then, the issue is, by your own showing, within the constitutional
guarantee of trial by jury in all suits at common
law where the matter in controversy is of the value of
<i>twenty</i> dollars. But is the claim made by the plaintiff "a
suit at common law"? What is a <i>suit</i>? The Supreme
Court thus answers the question:&mdash;"We understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
it [a suit] to be the prosecution or pursuit of some <i>claim</i>,
demand, or request. In law language, it is the prosecution
of some demand in a court of justice." (6 <i>Wheaton</i>, 407.)</p>

<p>It seems, then, that the Virginian, in claiming an inhabitant
of Boston as his slave, in fact brings <i>a suit</i> against
him for services due worth one thousand dollars. Now
remember, Sir, the fugitive is not to be delivered up, as a
mass of flesh, or inanimate matter, belonging to the claimant,
but as a debtor, in the phraseology of your own law,
"<i>owing</i> service or labor." The suit is brought for service
or labor <i>due</i>, and the Constitution provides that the person
so owing service or labor shall be delivered to him to
whom the same is "<i>due</i>." And now, is this suit for service
due "a suit at <i>common law</i>"? Again let the Supreme
Court answer. "The phrase <i>common law</i>, found in this
clause [the clause guaranteeing a jury trial], is used in contradistinction
to equity and admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.
It is well known, that, in civil causes in courts of
equity and admiralty, juries do not intervene, and that
courts of equity use the trial by jury only in extraordinary
cases, to inform the conscience of the court. When, therefore,
we find that the amendment requires that the right of
trial by jury shall be preserved in suits at common law,
the natural conclusion is, that this distinction was present
to the minds of the framers of the amendment. By <i>common
law</i>, they meant what the Constitution denominated,
in the third article, 'law'; not merely suits which the
common law recognized among its old and settled proceedings,
but suits in which legal rights were to be ascertained
and determined, in contradistinction to those where equitable
rights alone were recognized, and equitable remedies
were administered.... In a just sense, the amendment,
then, may be construed to embrace <i>all suits</i> which are not
of equity and admiralty jurisdiction, <i>whatever may be the
peculiar form</i> which they may assume to settle legal
rights." (3 <i>Peters</i>, 446.)</p>

<p>If there be meaning in words, these authorities settle the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
case, and your law is in palpable violation of the amendment
to the Constitution securing a trial by jury in suits
at common law where the matter in controversy exceeds
twenty dollars in value. Think not, Sir, that I am misrepresenting
the Supreme Court. I know well that the
<i>dicta</i> I have quoted have reference to <i>white</i> men, and that
they have been virtually set aside in decisions respecting
black men. I well know, that, in our model republic,
law and justice and morality are all cutaneous. But admitting
that the Supreme Court have stultified themselves,
and virtually denied, that, where a suit was brought for
the services of a <i>black</i> man, the Constitution required a
jury trial, recollect, Sir, that not in one single instance has
the court decided that the Constitution <i>prohibited</i> such a
trial. But if not prohibited, then Congress are permitted
to accord such a trial, and <i>both you and Mr. Webster have
declared that Congress had a right to grant such a trial,
and ought to grant it</i>. In voting, therefore, for a law
denying such a trial, you made a voluntary surrender to
the slaveholder of the security which such a trial would
have afforded to multitudes of your poor, ignorant, oppressed
fellow-men. For this act of cruelty and injustice,
committed against your own late conviction of duty, what
is your justification? Why, that the blacks had been
already deprived of the right of trial by jury fifty-seven
years!</p>

<p>Let us now see what tribunal you have substituted for
a jury in the trial of one of the most momentous issues
that can engage the attention of a court of justice. You
have provided for the appointment of an indefinite number
of judges, each of whom is to have exclusive jurisdiction
of these issues, and from whose judgment there is to be no
appeal. The Constitution declares, "The judges, both
of the Supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices
during good behaviour, and shall, at stated times, receive
for their services a compensation, which shall not be diminished
during their continuance in office." These judges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
are appointed by the Senate, on the nomination of the
President. Your herd of judges, called commissioners, are
appointed by the courts, and hold office during pleasure,
and instead of receiving a salary, are rewarded by a rule
the infamy of which, it is believed, belongs to your law
exclusively,&mdash;a rule which doubles their compensation
whenever they decide in favor of the rich plaintiff, and
<i>against</i> the poor and friendless defendant. But perhaps
you will deny that these men are judges; for, if judges,
their appointment is palpably unconstitutional. Let us
hear the Supreme Court, at a time when it was deemed
expedient to maintain that the persons who executed the
law of 1793 were <i>judges</i>. "It is plain, that, where a
claim is made by the owner out of possession for the delivery
of a slave, it must be made, if made at all, <i>against
some other person</i>; and inasmuch as the right is a right of
property, capable of being recognized and asserted by proceedings
<i>before a court of justice between parties adverse to
each other</i>, it constitutes, in the strictest sense, a <i>controversy</i>
between parties, and a case arising under the Constitution
of the United States, within the express delegation of judicial
power given by that instrument." (16 <i>Peters</i>, 616.)
Hence your commissioners are, in the <i>strictest sense</i>,
judges, exercising "judicial power" delegated by the
Constitution.</p>

<p>You pronounce Mr. Crittenden "legal authority of the
highest kind." This legal authority understands the sixth
section of your law as providing that each commissioner
"shall have judicial power and jurisdiction to hear, examine,
and decide the case in a summary manner." Now, if
a man, having judicial power and jurisdiction to decide
controversies between parties adverse to each other, in controversies
arising under the Constitution and within the
express delegation of judicial power given by that instrument,
is not a judge, do tell us who is one. Once more,
Sir, Mr. Crittenden says, "The legal authority of every
tribunal of exclusive jurisdiction, where no appeal lies, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
of necessity conclusive upon every tribunal; and therefore
the judgment of the tribunal created by this act is conclusive
upon all other tribunals." So your commissioner is
not only a judge, but he constitutes a tribunal of exclusive
jurisdiction, and his judgment is binding even upon the
Supreme Court of the United States. And yet, Sir, you
must deny that this omnipotent commissioner is a judge,
or you must admit, that, in the mode of his appointment,
you have flagrantly violated the Constitution of your
country.</p>

<p>It has been most wickedly asserted by our proslavery
presses and our proslavery politicians, that the surrender
of fugitives from labor and fugitives from justice are similar
proceedings. The surrender of a fugitive slave involves
two questions, that of identity and that of property;
and the law makes the decision of the commissioner on
both points final and conclusive upon every State and
Federal court in the land. The surrender of a fugitive
criminal involves only the question of personal identity.
The Governor of the State issues his warrant for the apprehension
and delivery of a certain person proved to him
to be charged with felony. If the officer arrests the wrong
person, he does it at his peril, and a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>
would immediately release the person wrongfully arrested.
Again, it is most fraudulently maintained, that, if the wrong
person is by the commissioner adjudged a slave, he may
sue for his freedom in a Southern court! Should he do so,
the exhibition of the commissioner's certificate is by law
declared to be conclusive <i>upon all tribunals</i>. But even
supposing that a Southern court, in defiance of law, should
go behind the certificate, how is a free colored person from
the North, working under the lash on a Mississippi plantation,
to prove his freedom? How is he to fee a lawyer?
How is he to get into court? If once there, where are
his witnesses? They are his friends and acquaintances of
his own color residing in the North. How are they to be
summoned to Mississippi? Should they venture to enter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the State, they would be imprisoned, and perhaps sold into
slavery; or even if permitted to enter the court-room, their
testimony would by law be excluded, against the claims
of a white man. How despicably profligate, then, is the
assumption of the advocates of your law, that any injustice
committed under it would be repaired by Southern
courts!</p>

<p>It was not enough, it seems, that the wretched defendant
in this momentous issue should be subjected to the
jurisdiction of a judge unknown to the Constitution, holding
his office by a prohibited tenure, incapable of being
impeached, and bribed to decide in favor of the plaintiff
by the promise of double fees, but the very trial allowed
him must be a burlesque on all the forms and principles
of juridical justice. The plaintiff, without notice to the
defendant, prepares himself for trial, and when his affidavits
or witnesses are all ready, he seizes the unsuspecting
victim in the street, and puts him <i>instanter</i> on his defence.
Had the wretched man been accused of some atrocious
crime, he might have demanded bail, and would have been
permitted to go at large to seek for counsel, to look for
witnesses, and to prepare for trial at some future day, of
which he would have due notice. But no such privilege
is allowed a man who is accused of <i>owing service</i>. One
of your commissioners has already decided that the law
does not permit him to bail the prisoner. The slave power
rides in triumph over all the barriers erected by the wisdom
of ages for the protection of human rights. The
defendant is brought, generally in irons, before your commissioner
judge, who is required "to hear and determine
the case of <i>the claimant</i> in a summary manner." The
law seems not even to imagine the possibility of any defence
being made on the part of the defendant. It makes
no provision for such a defence,&mdash;no assignment of counsel,
no summons for witnesses. We shall see presently,
that if the plaintiff makes out a <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> title, satisfactory
to the commission, it is all the law requires. Let me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
now call your attention to the practical working of your
diabolical law. A man named Rose was lately seized at
Detroit, and brought before a commissioner as a fugitive
slave. I copy from the newspaper report. "Mr. Joy
(counsel for defendant) moved a postponement of the trial
to a future day, to enable Rose to produce his papers to
establish his right to freedom, which papers he had <i>sworn</i>
were in Cincinnati. The counsel for the claimant denied
that the commissioner had any authority under the law to
grant a postponement. The commissioner agreed with
the counsel for the plaintiff, that <i>he had no authority to
postpone the trial</i>; and he further declared, that, <i>even were
the papers by which Rose was manumitted present, he
could not under the law receive them in evidence</i>."</p>

<p>Utterly devilish as was this decision, it was sound
law. The plaintiff had proved his title satisfactorily, and
this being done, the commissioner was bound by the express
words of the law to grant the certificate. He had
no right to admit rebutting evidence. It was sufficient to
prove that the prisoner had been the slave of the claimant's
father, and that the claimant was the heir at law of
his father. This of itself was satisfactory, and therefore
the commissioner had no right to admit in evidence the
very deed of manumission granted by the father to the
slave. The framers of the law had been as explicit as
they dared to be. "Upon satisfactory proof being made
by deposition or <i>affidavit</i>, to be taken and certified, &amp;c.,
or by other satisfactory testimony [of course, in writing,
and <i>ex parte</i>], and with proof, also by affidavit, of the
<i>identity</i> of the person," &amp;c., the defendant is to be surrendered.
Not a hint is given that any testimony may
be received to rebut the <i>satisfactory</i> proof given by the
plaintiff. You have, moreover, Sir, provided a species of
evidence never before heard of in the trial of an issue.
By the tenth section, the claimant may go before a judge
or court in Texas, and there make proof by affidavit that
<i>his</i> slave has escaped. Whereupon, the court or judge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
is to certify that the proof is satisfactory. A record of this
satisfactory proof, together with a description of the fugitive,
is to be made, and a certified transcript of this record,
"being exhibited to any judge, commissioner, or other officer
authorized," &amp;c., "<i>shall</i> be held and taken to be full
and conclusive evidence of the fact of escape, and that the
service or labor of the person escaping is <i>due</i> to the party
in such record mentioned." Here all defence is taken
from the defendant. Should he summon a host of witnesses
to prove his freedom, not one could be heard;
should he offer a bill of sale from the claimant to another,
it could not be received; should he produce a deed of
manumission, acknowledged and certified in a Southern
court, it would be waste paper. And thus a man's freedom
is to be sacrificed on an affidavit made a thousand
miles off. What, Sir, would you think of a law that
would authorize the seizure and sale of your property to
satisfy a debt which any man in California might think
proper to swear, before a Californian judge, was <i>due</i> from
you to him?</p>

<p>Such, Sir, is the <i>trial</i> which you, the representative of
Boston, a descendant of the Pilgrims, and "a gentleman of
property and standing," have accorded to the poor and
oppressed. Did the Constitution require such a prostitution
of justice, such an outrage of humanity, at your hands?
I need not be told that some of your commissioners have
not construed your law as strictly as did the Detroit functionary.
Thanks to the force of public opinion, and to the
zeal of some benevolent lawyers, whose hearts were not
padded with cotton, in some instances defendants have
been permitted to call witnesses in their behalf; and some
regard has been paid to the ordinary principles of justice.
But in all such instances, the spirit of the law and the
intentions of its framers have been frustrated.</p>

<p>And now let us listen to your "reason" for justifying all
the atrocities and abominations of your law. You gravely
tell us, "The entire population of the North has acqui<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>esced
in the law of 1793, without thinking itself exposed
to the charge of barbarity, and I have only to say, that I
do not think the charge any more just now." Certainly,
Sir, the young colonial judge could not have given a reason
less logical or satisfactory. You must be an inattentive
observer of passing events, if you are ignorant that the
law of 1793 has again and again been denounced as iniquitous,
that some of the States have prohibited their officers
from assisting in its execution, that numberless petitions
have been presented to Congress for its repeal, and
that you yourself, instead of acquiescing in it, solemnly declared
it to be the duty of Congress so far to alter the law,
as to grant the alleged fugitive a trial by jury. Yet the
law of 1793, wicked as it was, was justice and mercy
compared with yours. The trials under that were almost
invariably before judges of the State courts, not appointed
like your commissioners for the vile and only purpose of
reducing their fellow-men to bondage. There judges were
not confined to <i>ex parte</i> evidence, were not compelled to
receive "as full and conclusive" affidavits made in distant
States, and by unknown persons. For the most part, they
honestly endeavoured, by a patient investigation according
to the ordinary rules of evidence, and by holding the plaintiff
to strict legal proof, to supply the want of a jury.</p>

<p>David Paul Brown, Esq., of Philadelphia, in a letter of
last November, affirms that for the last thirty years he has
been engaged as counsel in almost every important fugitive
case brought before the judges and courts of Philadelphia,
and he tells us, "thanks to those upright and impartial and
independent judges by whom the rights of the parties were
finally determined," he knows of no instance in which a
colored person was, in his opinion, wrongfully surrendered.
But he adds, "I have known <span class="smcap">HUNDREDS</span> who have been
illegally and unjustly claimed." This experienced lawyer,
commenting on your law, justly says it allows "<i>ex parte</i>
testimony to be received against the alleged fugitive, which,
upon no principle known to the common law, could be re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>ceived
upon the claim to a horse or a dog." About four
weeks after the date of this letter, Mr. Brown was called to
defend an alleged fugitive "illegally and unjustly claimed,"
not before one of the "upright and impartial and independent"
Pennsylvania judges, but before one of your ten-dollar
slave-catching judges. I beg you to mark the result.</p>

<p>On the 21st of December, a colored man was arrested in
the street in Philadelphia, without warrant, and accused of
stealing chickens. He was thrust into a carriage, driven to
the State-House, carried into an upper room, and handcuffed.
In this state he was detained till a commissioner
arrived. The name of this executor of your law is worthy
of remembrance. <span class="smcap">Edward D. Ingraham</span> ought to be as
much endeared to slave-catchers, as Judge Jeffries was to
James the Second.</p>

<p>By some means, the arrest became known, and counsel
appeared for the prisoner. Your commissioner was informed
that the prisoner had only been seized an hour and
a half before, and had not heard the charge against him;
that his counsel had had no time to learn the plaintiff's
case, nor to prepare for the defence; that there were persons
residing at a distance, some in New Jersey and some
in Wilmington, who would be important witnesses in his
behalf. On these grounds, a motion was made for a continuance.
And what, Sir, do you suppose was the reply
made by the slave-catching judge to this motion? "<span class="smcap">The
hearing is to be a summary one: let it proceed.</span>" No
doubt you fully participate in Mr. Webster's indignation
against Austrian barbarity; but see no barbarity in this accursed
proceeding against a <i>colored</i> American. The hearing
did proceed, and James S. Price, on behalf of the plaintiff,
swore that the prisoner was Emery Rice, the man
claimed, but knew nothing further about his being a slave,
except that he had seen him riding the claimant's horse.
Had <i>heard it said</i> the prisoner was a slave. This was the
amount of the testimony on behalf of the claimant. Any
honest jury, nay, any honest judge, would instantly have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
decided in favor of the prisoner. Not so <span class="smcap">Mr. Edward D.
Ingraham</span>. The counsel for the defendant asked again for
a postponement, and founded the motion on the <i>oath</i> of the
defendant, that he could procure six persons, naming them,
to testify to his freedom. A delay of <span class="smcap">ONE HOUR</span> was asked
for. This was refused, and the judge(!) sent for a certificate
to sign. During the delay thus occasioned, one of the
six persons named by the defendant appeared, and swore
that he had known the prisoner all his life. That he was
not Emery Rice, but Adam Gibson; that he was a freeman,
having been manumitted by the will of his late master.
Mr. Brown produced a copy of the will of the late
master, and it so far confirmed the testimony of the witness.
Another person in the crowd now came forward, and
swore that he also knew the prisoner, and that he was a
free person, and that he was Adam Gibson. But all was
in vain. The commissioner signed the certificate, and,
with an obtuseness of intellect which marked him as a fit
subject for a commission of lunacy, declared, "He had no
doubt of the identity of the prisoner with the slave Emery
Rice, and that <i>all other proceedings must be before the
courts of Maryland</i>, whither he would send him."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And
so the prisoner, without seeing his wife and children, whom
he had that morning parted from unsuspicious of danger
and unconscious of crime, was hurried off at the expense of
our glorious model republic, under an escort of officers,
who delivered him, not to the courts of Maryland, but to
Mr. William S. Knight, the reputed owner. But Mr.
Knight told the officers, "You have brought me a wrong
man; this is not Emery Rice; this man is no slave of
mine." And so Adam Gibson returned to Philadelphia,
and is now a living illustration of the abominable iniquity
of one of the most accursed laws to be found in the statute-book
of any civilized nation.</p>

<p>You do not think your law more barbarous than that of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
1793. Let me further enlighten you. Judge McLean of
the Supreme Court, in his opinion delivered last May in
the case of <i>Norris</i> v. <i>Newton et al.</i>, remarks,&mdash;"In regard
to the arrest of fugitives from labor, the law [act of
1793] <i>does not impose any active duties on our citizens
generally</i>"; and he argues in defence of the law, that "it
gives no one a just right to complain; he has only to refrain
from an express violation of the law." In other
words, the law only required individuals to be passive spectators
of a horrible outrage, and did not compel them to be
active participators in other men's villany. Now, what
says your law? Why, that every commissioner may appoint
as many official slave-catchers as he pleases, and that
each of these menials may "summon and call to their aid
the <i>by-standers</i> or <i>posse comitatus</i> of the proper county,
when necessary to insure a faithful observance of the
clause of the Constitution referred to in conformity with
the provisions of this act, <span class="smcap">AND ALL GOOD CITIZENS ARE HEREBY
COMMANDED TO AID AND ASSIST</span> in the prompt and efficient
execution of this law, whenever their services may be required."
And what is the fate you have provided for the
"good citizen," who, believing slavery to be sinful, cannot,
in the fear of God, "aid and assist" in making a fellow-man
a slave? Any person "who shall aid, abet, or assist"
the fugitive "directly or indirectly" (cunning words) to
escape from such claimant, as, for instance, refusing to join
in a slave-hunt when required, shall be fined not exceeding
$1,000, be imprisoned six months, and pay the claimant
$1,000. I hope, Sir, you are now able to perceive that
your law has a pre&euml;minence in barbarity over its predecessor.
And now, Sir, please to recollect, that party discipline,
aided by the influence of Messrs. Webster and Clay,
and the factory and cotton interest of Boston and New York,
could not procure for this atrocious law the votes of <i>one
half</i> the members of the House of Representatives. Of
two hundred and thirty-two members, only one hundred
and nine dared to place their names on an enduring and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
shameful record, while many basely deserted their seats,
fearing alike to vote either for or against it. You, Sir, following
Mr. Webster's advice, "conquered your prejudices,"
and in company with <i>two</i> more Northern Whigs, one of
them a native of Virginia, cast your vote for this bill of
abominations. But, although you voted for the law, you
do not wish your constituents to suppose you approved of
it. "It will not, I trust, be inferred from any thing I have
said, that I consider the law which has passed unexceptionable.
There are amendments which I strongly desire
to be introduced into it." What are the exceptionable features
of the law, what are the amendments you desire, you
refrain from specifying. But you tell us that you would
have labored for these amendments "had it been possible,
but every body knows that it was <i>impracticable</i>." You
allude to the <i>previous question</i>, which prevented both discussion
and amendments. But why, then, did you vote
for an objectionable bill which could not be amended?
Here, again, we have one of your unfortunate reasons.
"I deem conformity to the design of the Constitution more
important than the objectionable details of the bill." So,
by your own confession, had there been no previous question,
you would have swallowed the bill with all its objectionable
details, out of reverence for the <i>design</i> of the
Constitution, although that design neither embraced nor
required a single one of those details. Did you, Sir, vote
<i>against</i> the previous question? On this point you are silent,
and the minutes afford no information; but <i>if</i> you did,
your vote was a most remarkable aberration from your proslavery
course in Congress. <i>After</i> the previous question
had been seconded, it was moved to lay the bill on the
table. Had this motion been carried, you might have
introduced another bill, omitting the "objectionable details,"
but you voted with the slaveholders. The slaveholders
then moved that the bill be read a third time.
Had this been lost, there would have been a chance of
correcting the "objectionable details." Again you voted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
with the slaveholders, and a third time, also, on the main
question.</p>

<p>I will now, Sir, call your attention to the disastrous influence
which your law has exerted on the <i>moral sense</i> of
the community. Says Coleridge, "To dogmatize a
crime, that is, to teach it as a doctrine, is itself a crime."
Of this crime of dogmatizing crime, Mr. Webster, and most
of our cotton politicians, and, alas! many of our fashionable,
genteel divines, are guilty; nor are you innocent, Sir,
who in your law require "<span class="smcap">GOOD</span> citizens" to aid in hunting
and enslaving their fellow-men.</p>

<p>In former years, and before Mr. Webster had undergone
his metamorphosis, he thus, in a speech at New York, expressed
himself in regard to the antislavery agitation at
the North. "It [slavery] has arrested the <i>religious feeling</i>
of the country; it has taken strong hold of the consciences
of men. He is a rash man indeed, little conversant with
human nature, and especially has he a very erroneous estimate
of the character of the people of this country, who
supposes that a feeling of this kind is <i>to be trifled with or
despised</i>." This gentleman has become the rash man
shadowed forth in his speech, and is trifling with and despising
the religious feeling of the North. In his street
speech in Boston, in favor of slave-hunting, he avowed
that he was well aware that the return of fugitives "is a
topic that must excite prejudices," and that the question for
Massachusetts to decide was, "whether she will conquer
her own prejudice." In his letter to the citizens of Newburyport,
he sneeringly alludes to the "cry that there is a
rule for the government of public men and private men
which is superior to the Constitution," and he scornfully
intimates that Mr. Horace Mann, who had objected to your
law as wicked, would do well "to appeal at once, as others
do, to that high authority which sits enthroned above the
Constitution and the laws"; and he gives an extract from
a nameless English correspondent, in which the writer remarks,
"Religion is an excellent thing except in politics,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
a maxim exceedingly palatable to very many of our politicians.
Aware that the impiety of this sentiment was not
exactly suited to the meridian of Massachusetts, he says
his friend undoubtedly meant "a fantastical notion of religion."
Of course, he regards the religious prejudice
against hunting and enslaving men as springing from a fantastic
notion of religion. Yet, with a strange fatuity, he
confesses that "the teaching of Christ and his Apostles is
a sure guide to duty in <i>politics</i>, as in any other concern of
life," utterly oblivious of the fact, that the "higher law,"
which he ridicules, was proclaimed in that very teaching.
Christ taught, "Fear not them [magistrates] who kill the
body, but are not able to kill the soul, but rather fear <span class="smcap">Him</span>
who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell." What
taught the Apostles? "We must obey God, rather than
man." Such teaching it was, that gave birth to "the noble
army of martyrs," and this very teaching will induce
multitudes of Christians at the present day to hazard fines
and imprisonment rather than obey the wicked injunctions
of your law. It was this same teaching which, on the publication
of your law, induced numerous ministers of Jesus
Christ, and various ecclesiastical assemblies, to denounce it
as wicked, and obedience to it as rebellion against God.
This expression of religious sentiment alarmed both our
politicians and our merchants. How could the one expect
Southern votes, or the other Southern trade, if the religious
people at the North refused to catch slaves? Hence arose
a mighty outcry against the blending of religion with politics,
and most fearful were the anathemas against the parsons
who desecrated the pulpit by preaching politics, that
is, preaching that people ought to obey God rather than
the Fugitive Slave Act. Such men were, in the language
of one of the New York commercial journals, "clerical
preachers of rebellion," and their congregations were exhorted
to "leave them to naked walls." But the leaven
was at work, and an antidote was greatly wanted. Supply
of course follows demand, and forthwith there was a sud<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>den
advent of cotton clergyman, preaching against rebellion,
and cunningly confounding a conscientious, passive
disobedience with forcible resistance. Their sermons, in
which virtually</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The image of God was accounted as base,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the image of C&aelig;sar set up in its place,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>were received with mighty applause by the very men who
had been striving to save the pulpit from all contaminating
contact with politics, and the reverend preachers of cotton
politics were elevated into patriots, and their disquisitions
against the "higher law" were scattered on the wings of
the commercial press broadcast over the land.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The theology
which holds that the allegiance we owe to civil government
binds the conscience to obedience to its mandates,
is the same with which Shakspeare's assassin quieted his
scruples when acting under the royal command,&mdash;"If a
king bid a man be a villain, he is bound by the indenture
of his oath to be one."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>It is amusing to observe with what awful reverence our
merchants and brokers regard the sanctity of human law,
when it commands them to catch slaves; a reverence not
always felt by them for the statute of usury when the
money market is tight.</p>

<p>A vast deal of nonsense and impiety has been recently
thrown upon the public in relation to the "higher law,"
by men who had political and pecuniary interests depend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>ing
on the good-will of the slaveholders. The whole subject
is perfectly simple and intelligible, and has been intentionally
misrepresented and mystified.</p>

<p>Human government is indispensable to the happiness
and progress of human society. Hence God, in his wisdom
and benevolence, wills its existence; and in this
sense, and this alone, the powers that be are ordained by
him. But civil government cannot exist, if each individual
may, at his pleasure, forcibly resist its injunctions.
Therefore Christians are required to <i>submit</i> to the powers
that be, whether a Nero or a slave-catching Congress. But
obedience to the civil ruler often necessarily involves rebellion
to God. Hence we are warned by Christ and his
Apostles, and by the example of saints in all ages, in such
cases, not to obey, but to submit and suffer. We are to
hold fast our allegiance to Jehovah, but at the same time
not take up arms to defend ourselves against the penalties
imposed by the magistrate for our disobedience. Thus the
Divine sovereignty and the authority of human government
are both maintained. Revolution is not the abolition
of human government, but a change in its form, and its
lawfulness depends on circumstances. What was the
"den" in which John Bunyan had his glorious vision of
the Pilgrim's Progress? A prison to which he was confined
for years for refusing obedience to human laws. And
what excuse did this holy man make for conduct now
denounced as wicked and rebellious? "I cannot obey,
but I can suffer." The Quakers have from the first refused
to obey the law requiring them to bear arms; yet have they
never been vilified by our politicians and cotton clergymen,
as rebels against the powers that be, nor sneered at for
their acknowledgment of a "higher" than human law.
The Lord Jesus Christ, after requiring us to love God and
our neighbour, added, "There is none other commandment
greater than these"; no, not even a slave-catching act of
Congress, which requires us to hunt our neighbour, that
he may be reduced to the condition of a beast of burden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Rarely has the religious faith of the community received
so rude a shock as that which has been given it by your
horrible law, and the principles advanced by its political
and clerical supporters. Cruelty, oppression, and injustice
are elevated into virtues, while justice, mercy, and compassion
are ridiculed and vilified.</p>

<p>But lately, the business of catching slaves was regarded
as one of the lowest grades of scoundrelism. Now, great
pains are taken by our gentlemen of property and standing
to ennoble it; and men of eminence in the legal profession
are stooping to take the wages of iniquity, and lending
themselves to consign to the horrors of American slavery
men whom they know to be innocent of crime. Nay, we
have seen in New York a committee of gentlemen actually
<i>raising money by voluntary contribution</i> to furnish a slave-catcher
with professional services gratis;&mdash;a free gift, not
to mitigate human misery, but to aggravate the hardships
of the poor and friendless a thousandfold. Can men of
standing in the community thus openly espouse the cause
of cruelty and oppression, and, from commercial and political
views, trample upon every principle of Christian benevolence,
without corrupting the moral sense of the people
to the extent of their influence? When gentlemen club
together to hire a lawyer to assist a slave-catcher, no wonder
that the commercial press should teem with the vilest
abuse of all who feel sympathy for the fugitive. One of
the most malignant proslavery journals in New York is
edited by your colleague and fellow-Whig, the Honorable
Mr. Brooks, and his brother. I copy, Sir, for your consideration,
the following article from the <i>New York Evening
Express</i>, published during the late trial in that city of
Henry Long, an alleged fugitive:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Two fugitive cases are now before our courts; one
that of the negro Henry Long, and the other that of three
white Frenchmen, under the extradition treaty with France.
The negro's case makes a great deal of noise, because he
is black; the three white Frenchmen are hardly heard of.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
The three white French people pay their own counsel:
they may have committed a robbery in Paris, or may not;
are perhaps innocent, though possibly guilty; but here
they are on trial, with no chance of a trial before a jury!
If they are sent back, and are convicted, they go to the
galleys, and are slaves for life. The negro, Henry Long,
lucky fellow for being black! lives in clover here, and has
one of the best speakers in the city, on the best fee, interests
all the Abolitionists in all quarters, who contribute
money freely for his defence, and if he is returned, leaves
here canonized as a martyr, and goes back to the condition
he was born in, to fatten on hog and hominy, better fed
and better clothed than nine tenths of the farm laborers in
Great Britain. Another consideration strikes us, and that
is, the cost of defending Long will buy his freedom three
times over. The very fee of his counsel would purchase
his freedom. But to buy him and pay for him, <i>not steal</i>
him, would leave no room for agitation. And where does
this money come from, that cares for Long and neglects
the three Frenchmen? From England, in the main, we
believe. The Abolitionists here do not <i>contribute it</i>."</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find in the Satanic press a more
clumsy piece of malignant falsehood. We have here, from
the same pen, and in the same article, the assertions, that
the Abolitionists, in all quarters, we are assured, "contribute
money freely for his defence"; and then the money,
it is believed, comes mainly from England. "The Abolitionists
here do not contribute it." To contribute money
for the legal defence of a fugitive is <i>stealing him</i>. The
cost of defending Long amounted to three times the price
that would be asked for him. Long, after his return, sold
in Richmond for $750; of course his defence cost $2,250.
To whom, and for what, was this money paid? Long
could not be bought in New York, all advances for the
purpose being peremptorily repulsed. His counsel's fee
was $300, being all contributed in New York, and about
$100 of it being raised by the free colored people. While<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
$300 were thus raised to give Long the chance of a legal
defence, gentlemen of the New York Union Safety Committee,
of which your colleague has the honor of being a
member, contributed $500 to aid the slave-catcher in reducing
to bondage a man unaccused of crime!</p>

<p>I am inclined to believe, Sir, that you have little cause
to congratulate yourself, that, in voting for the Fugitive
Slave Law, you have advanced the cause of truth, justice,
humanity, or religion.</p>

<p>A refusal to <i>obey</i> your wicked law has been artfully represented
as a determination to <i>resist</i> its execution. Very
few of our white population have intimated the most distant
intention of resorting to illegal violence. Very many
ecclesiastical bodies have denounced your law as so iniquitous,
that they could not in conscience obey it; but I
challenge you to point to a <i>single instance</i> in which such
a body has recommended forcible resistance. To the vast
accumulation of impiety uttered in support of your law
has been added a fiendish ridicule of the benevolent and
Christian feeling arrayed against it. It is true, that some
of our free blacks and fugitives have declared, that they
would, at the hazard of their lives, defend themselves
against the kidnapper. Whatever may be thought of the
wisdom of such a determination, be assured it will tax
your logical powers to the utmost to prove that God has
conferred the right of self-defence exclusively upon white
men. The slave is a prisoner of war, and instead of being
protected by law, he is subjected by it to every conceivable
outrage. When murdered, his owner seeks in the courts
<i>damages</i> at the hands of the murderer, as he would for the
death of his horse. For no possible injury committed on
his person, either by his owner or others, can he receive
compensation, although the law may profess to punish
cruelty to him as to other animals. Now it has never been
regarded as immoral, by those who admit the right of self-defence,
for a prisoner of war to effect his escape by slaying
his guard. All this, I know, will horrify a certain class<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of our divines and politicians. But let them be patient.
I am not laying down a doctrine, but stating <i>facts</i>, which
they may disprove if they can. Let them remember, that
all the slavery which they delight to find in the Bible was
the slavery of <i>white</i> men, and that the Roman slaves in
the time of Christ, whose bondage, we are told, he and his
Apostles approved, were held by the <i>right of war</i>. White
Americans have been held as slaves by the same holy and
Scriptural tenure. Let us, then, inquire how the escape
and resistance of white slaves have heretofore been regarded.
In 1535, the <i>white</i> slaves in Tunis alone amounted
to twenty thousand. Cervantes, who had himself been a
slave in Algiers, says in his writings, "For liberty we
ought to risk life itself; slavery being the greatest evil
that can fall to the lot of man." Acting upon this precept,
he himself, while a slave, planned a general insurrection of
the slaves. Yet Cervantes was recognized as a faithful
son of the Church, and the license prefixed to his works
declares they contain nothing contrary to the Christian
religion. The Annual Register for 1763 announces, that,
"last month, the Christian slaves at Algiers, to the number
of four thousand, rose and killed their guards, and massacred
all who came in their way." The insurrection was
suppressed, but no one in Europe denounced the insurgents
as bloodthirsty wretches, nor regarded their effort as
an impious and anti-Christian rebellion against the powers
ordained of God. In the reign of Elizabeth, one John Fox,
a slave on the Barbary coast, slew his master, and, effecting
his escape with a number of his fellow-slaves, arrived in
England. The queen, instead of looking upon him as a
murderer, testified her admiration of his exploit by allowing
him a pension.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Washington Madison performed a similar exploit on
board an American coast slaver, and arrived, with a large
number of his fellow-slaves, in the British West Indies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Mr. Webster, then Secretary of State, officially demanded
of the British government the surrender of this heroic man
as a <span class="smcap">MURDERER</span>.</p>

<p>In 1793, there were one hundred and fifteen American
slaves in Algiers, held by as perfect and Scriptural a tenure
as any slave is now held in any part of our wide republic.
Had one of these slaves made his escape by killing his
Algerine master, would any of our patriotic divines, would
any gentleman of the "New York Union Committee of
Safety," would even Mr. Webster himself, have pronounced
him a murderer? Had the captain of a British ship favored
his escape, and given him a passage to Boston, would your
colleague, the Honorable Mr. Brooks, have accused him of
slave-stealing? Is it not possible, Sir, that, with very many
of our casuists and moralists, questions of conscience are
decided according to the tincture of a skin?</p>

<p>I will now ask your attention to some of the political
consequences resulting from the late measures in which
you rejoice, and for which you voted. No sooner had
Congress made the required concessions to the slave power,
than the advocates of those measures claimed the glory of
having given peace to the country, and perpetuity to the
Union. Mr. Webster, as one of the chief agents in this
blessed consummation, received the congratulations of a
crowd in Washington. In his reply he observed,&mdash;"Truly,
gentlemen, the last two days have been great
days. A work has been accomplished which dissipates
doubts and alarms, puts an end to angry controversies, fortifies
the Constitution of the country, and strengthens the
bond of the Union.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The glorious summer anticipated by the orator proved
cold and brief, and if the lowering clouds were indeed
buried in the ocean, the sea has given up its dead. Never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
before, since the organization of the government, has such
a tempest of indignation swept over the land. Never before,
in a single instance, has there been manifested throughout
the religious portion of the community, of all creeds
and names, such a settled determination in the fear of God
to withhold obedience to a law of the land. The sentiments
of the great mass of the people of the free States,
exclusive of the commercial cities, are briefly but emphatically
embodied in a resolution of the Common Council of
Chicago, viz.:&mdash;"The Fugitive Slave Act recently passed
by Congress is revolting to our moral sense, and an outrage
on our feelings of justice and humanity, because it disregards
all the securities which the Constitution and laws
have thrown around personal liberty, and its direct tendency
is to alienate the people from their love and reverence
for the government and institutions of our country."</p>

<p>How far the clouds which hovered over our house have
been dissipated, let the recent rout of Mr. Webster's party
in Massachusetts testify. Let his own declaration, a month
after the <i>peace</i> measures were adopted, that the Union was
passing through a <i>fiery trial</i>, testify.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> How far the work
of the two days has fortified the Constitution, let the recent
law of Vermont, denounced as an utter nullification of
the Constitution, because it rescues the alleged fugitive
from the hands of the commissioner, and gives him a jury
trial before a State court, testify. When rumors were rife
that Mr. Webster intended to repudiate his own thunder,
the Wilmot Proviso, the <i>New York Herald</i>, the chief
Northern organ of the slaveholders, promised that, if the
Senator would indeed pursue a course so patriotic, a grateful
country would, at the next election, place him in the
Presidential chair. But scarcely had the acts advocated
by Mr. Webster been consummated, than the <i>Herald</i>, with
sardonic malice, announces,&mdash;"The predictions of Mr.
Clay, that the Compromise Bill would speedily conciliate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>all parties, and restore the era of good feeling, were exactly
the reverse of the actual consequences. Mr. Webster has
been cast overboard in Massachusetts. General Cass has
been virtually condemned in Michigan. Mr. Dickinson,
the President, and his cabinet, have been routed in New
York. Mr. Phelps has been superseded in Vermont.
Whilst in Ohio, Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin, the Free-Soilers
have carried off the booty." And he winds up with
declaring, that the next President "can't be Fillmore nor
Webster."</p>

<p>If the "peace measures" have strengthened the bond of
the Union, what mean all the meetings lately held to <i>save
the Union</i>? Why is the tocsin now sounded by the very
authors and friends of the measures? How comes it that,
in Boston itself, the chairman of a Union meeting contradicts
the exulting and jubilant shout of triumph uttered by
the Secretary of State, and makes the following doleful
announcement:&mdash;"The Union, and consequently the existence
of this nation, is menaced, and unless there is a
great and general effort in their support, we may soon behold
the mighty fabric of our government trembling over
our heads, and threatening by its fall to crush the prosperity
which we have so long and happily enjoyed." So relaxed
has become the bond of our Union, that one hundred
gentlemen of property and standing in New York have,
under the style and title of "The New York Union Committee
of Safety," assumed the onerous task of taking it
into their safe-keeping. "Committees of safety" are associated
with times of peril and anarchy, and are never
wanted when alarms have ceased, angry discussions ended,
the Constitution fortified, and the bond of union strengthened.</p>

<p>In this universal panic, in this dread entertained, especially
in Boston, by Mr. Webster's friends, of soon seeing the
mighty fabric of our government trembling over their
heads, it may, Sir, be consolatory to you and others to
know how so dire a calamity may be averted. The chiv<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>alric
Senator from Mississippi&mdash;the gentleman who threatens
to hang one Senator if he dare place his foot on the
soil of Mississippi, who draws a loaded pistol on another,
and for a third bears a challenge to mortal combat&mdash;was
lately in the city of New York. The Committee of Safety
found him out, and lauded him for his fearless discharge of
duty, and his fervor and devotion to the Union, and welcomed
him to the commercial emporium in the name of all
who appreciate the blessings we enjoy, and are willing to
transmit them to their children. The worthy and conciliatory
gentleman very appropriately communicated to the
committee having the Union in charge the conditions on
which alone it could be saved, notwithstanding its bond
had so recently been strengthened. These conditions are,
we learn, four in number.</p>

<p>1. "The Fugitive Slave Bill passed by Congress shall
remain the law of the land, and be faithfully executed."</p>

<p>Both you and Mr. Webster admit that the Constitution
permits a jury trial to the fugitive. Should Congress, in
its wisdom, and in obedience to the wishes of the great
mass of the Northern population, and in the exercise of its
constitutional power, elevate property in a human being to
the same level with that in a horse, and permit a jury to
pass upon the title to it,&mdash;<i>the Union must be dissolved</i>.</p>

<p>2. "The Wilmot Proviso, that monstrous thing, shall not
be revived." It was not courteous, certainly, in Mr. Foote
thus to characterize Mr. Webster's thunder. The claim to
this thunder was made in his speech, September, 1847, at
the Springfield Convention, which nominated him for
President; and the Convention, in his presence, thus declared
their devotion to his missile. "The Whigs of Massachusetts
now declare, and put this declaration of their
purpose <i>on record</i>, that Massachusetts will never consent
that Mexican territories, however acquired, shall become a
part of the American Union, unless on the <i>unalterable</i> condition
that there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary
servitude, otherwise than in punishment for crime." The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
next year Mr. Webster launched his thunder over the Territory
of Oregon, and thus in his speech (10th August,
1848) vindicated it from the character now given to it by
Mr. Foote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentlemen from the South declare that we invade
their rights when we deprive them of a participation in
the enjoyment of territories acquired by the common services
and common exertions of all. Is this true? Of what
do we deprive them? Why, they say that we deprive
them of the privilege of carrying their slaves as slaves into
the new territories. Well, Sir, what is the amount of
that? They say, that in this way we deprive them of
going into this acquired territory with their property.
Their property! What do they mean by this 'property'?
We certainly do not deprive them of the privilege of going
into those newly acquired territories with all that, in the
general estimate of human society and common and universal
understanding of mankind, is esteemed property.
Not at all. The truth is just this. They have in their
own States peculiar laws which create property in persons....
The real meaning, then, of Southern gentlemen,
in making this complaint, is, that they cannot go into the
territories of the United States carrying with them their
own peculiar law, a law which creates property in persons."</p>

<p>So the Wilmot Proviso was no monstrous thing at all,
as applied to Oregon. When the question came up of
applying this same Proviso to New Mexico and California,
Mr. Webster discovered in these Territories a certain peculiarity
of physical geography and Asiatic scenery which
he had not discovered in Oregon, and which, he found,
rendered it a physical impossibility for Southern gentlemen
to carry there "a law which creates property in persons,"
and he therefore gave them full liberty to carry their law
into those vast regions, if they could. But at the very
moment of giving this liberty to Southern gentlemen, he
courageously warned them that his thunder was good con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>stitutional
thunder, and would be used whenever necessary.
"Wherever there is an <i>inch of land</i> to be stayed back from
becoming slave territory, I am ready to insert the principle
of the exclusion of slavery. I am pledged to that from
1837,&mdash;pledged to it again and again, and I will perform
those pledges." So, should we get another slice of Mexico,
or annex Cuba or St. Domingo, Mr. Webster would revive
the Wilmot Proviso, and then <i>he</i> will be the means,
if he succeeds, of dissolving the Union!</p>

<p>3. The next condition announced to the Safety Committee
is,&mdash;"No attempt shall be made in Congress to prohibit
slavery in the District of Columbia."</p>

<p>Now it is the opinion of Mr. Webster, that Congress has
the constitutional right, not merely to attempt, but actually
to effect, the exclusion of slavery in <i>all</i> the Territories of the
United States. The District of Columbia being placed by
the Constitution expressly under "the exclusive jurisdiction"
of Congress, the <i>constitutional</i> right to abolish slavery
there has rarely been questioned; but it has been contended
that good faith to the States which ceded the District
forbids such an act of constitutional power. Hence,
in 1838, a resolution was introduced into the Senate declaring
that the abolition of slavery in the District would
be "a violation of good faith," &amp;c. What said Mr. Webster?
"I do not know any matter of fact, or any ground
of argument, on which this affirmation of plighted faith
can stand. I see nothing in the act of cession, and nothing
in the Constitution, and nothing in the transaction, implying
any limitation on the authority of Congress."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>4. The last condition on which the Union can be
preserved is,&mdash;"No State shall be prevented from coming
into the Union on the ground of having slavery." This
is an unkind cut at Mr. Webster, since he has again and
again pledged himself against the admission of slave States.
Even so early as 1819, he advocated, in a public meeting
at Boston, a resolution declaring that Congress "possessed
the constitutional power, upon the admission of any new
State created beyond the limits of the original territory of
the United States, to make the prohibition of the further
extension of slavery or involuntary servitude in such new
State a condition of admission. That, in the opinion of
this meeting, it is just and expedient that this power
should be exercised by Congress upon the admission of all
new States created beyond the original limits of the United
States." In his New York speech, in 1837, he averred,
"When it is proposed to bring new members into the political
partnership, the old members have a right to say on
what terms such new partners are to come in, and <i>what they
are to bring along with them</i>." In his Springfield speech,
he insisted, "There is no one [he forgot Mr. Foote and
his other Southern friends] who can complain of the North
for resisting the increase of <i>slave representation</i>, because it
gives power to the minority in a manner inconsistent with
the principles of our government." So late as 1848, he
proclaimed on the floor of the Senate, "I shall oppose all
such extension [slave representation] at all times and under
all circumstances, even against all inducements, against all
combinations, against all compromises."</p>

<p>The State of Georgia, in her convention of December
last, added a <i>fifth</i> condition to those stated by Mr. Foote
as indispensable to the preservation of the Union, viz.:&mdash;"No
act suppressing the slave-trade between the slaveholding
States." Unfortunately for Mr. Webster, he is
here, for the fifth time, virtually held up as a disorganizer,
and an enemy of the Union; for in his speech in the Senate
(6th February, 1837) he remarked,&mdash;"As to the point,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the right of regulating the transfer of slaves from one State
to another, he did not know that he entertained any doubt,
because the Constitution gave Congress the right to regulate
trade and commerce between the States. Trade in
what? In whatever was the subject of commerce and
ownership. If slaves were the subjects of ownership, then
trade in them between the States was subject to the regulation
of Congress."</p>

<p>Mr. Webster declared, that the work of the two days
in which he rejoiced had fortified the Constitution, and
strengthened the bond of the Union; and yet we are now
solemnly warned, by the very men and party with whom
he is acting, that the bond is to be severed, should Congress
pass any one of five laws, all and each of which he,
the great expounder, declares the Constitution authorizes
Congress to pass. So it seems the great peril to which we
are exposed, the course which is to make the fabric of our
government to tremble over the heads of the people of
Boston, is, not the violation of the Constitution, nor the
breach of its compromises, nor the invasion of the rights
of the South, but the exercise by Congress of powers
which Mr. Webster declares to be undoubtedly constitutional.
The Abolitionists supposed they were following
a safe guide when they confined themselves, in their petitions
to Congress for legislative action against slavery,
exclusively to such measures as they were assured, by the
eminent expounder, were strictly constitutional. The Abolitionists
have sympathized with this gentleman in the obloquy
he incurred, in common with themselves, for holding
opinions unpalatable to the slaveholders, and for maintaining
the constitutional rights of Congress. Because he
insisted, in the Senate, on the power of Congress over
slavery and the slave-trade in the District of Columbia,
Mr. Rives, of Virginia, was so unkind as to say, that the
gentleman from Massachusetts, "if it so pleased his fancy,
might disport himself in tossing squibs and firebrands about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>this hall; but those who are sitting upon a barrel of gunpowder,
liable to be blown up by his dangerous missiles,
could hardly be expected to be quite as calm and philosophic."
Because he presented antislavery petitions, and
insisted on the duty of Congress to consider them, Mr.
King, of Alabama, affirmed that the course which the Senator
from Massachusetts had taken had "placed him at the
head of those men who are inundating Congress with their
petitions." Strange as it may now seem, Mr. Cuthbert, of
Georgia, told Mr. Webster to his face in the Senate, "The
gentleman had uniformly been opposed to all those measures
which tended to quiet the country and heal those
sectional dissensions which distract the Union."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Surely,
when the Abolitionists have so long made Mr. Webster
their polar star in all constitutional questions, and have
incurred with him the accusation of tossing squibs and
firebrands, and of opposing measures which tended to quiet
the country and settle sectional dissensions, they had a
right to expect from his friends a larger share of compassion
and forbearance than they have experienced.</p>

<p>It would seem, Sir, that, in the late treaty of peace between
the North and the South, it has been agreed and
understood, that every power granted by the Constitution,
whereby slavery can be protected, extended, and perpetuated,
is to be actively enforced; and that every power
which might be used for curtailing human bondage, however
unquestionable may be its grant, shall for ever remain
dormant, under the penalty of an immediate dissolution of
the Union. This, Sir, is the treaty which our commercial
cities are glorifying; this is the treaty which has turned
our "winter of discontent" into "glorious summer." And
think you, Sir, that the slaveholders, having eyes, see not,
and having understandings, perceive not, the haberdashery
patriotism which rejoices in such a treaty, and denounces as
"fanatics," "vipers," and "woolly-headed philanthropists,"
all who do not confess it to be a glorious consummation?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
The Southern papers tell us that our Union meetings are
got up to "sell a little more tape and flannel"; and they
remark, "It is very queer that Union meetings are held
only in places which trade with the South." Out of regard
to their Southern brethren, a member of the British
House of Commons was insulted in Faneuil Hall by a portion
of the Boston people, and forthwith the <i>New Orleans
Delta</i>, instead of gratefully acknowledging the compliment,
remarks, that their "good Union-loving friends in Boston
are now solacing the South with sugar-plums in the shape
of resolutions and speeches, and spice in the form of a row,
got up on the occasion of the first appearance of George
Thompson, an imported incendiary and hireling agitator.
Such manifestation possesses an advantage which doubtless
constitutes no small recommendation with our good brethren
of Boston,&mdash;it is very cheap. The <i>cottoncratical</i>
clerks and warehousemen may raise a hubbub in Faneuil
Hall, but the fanatics can slay them at the <i>polls</i>."</p>

<p>It is some consolation to those who are now suffering all
the contempt and opprobrium which can be thrown both
upon their heads and their hearts, because they have refused
to follow Mr. Webster in the devious paths in which
it has lately been his pleasure to walk, that they have by
their constancy and firmness extorted from their Southern
antagonists a tribute which is not paid to their revilers.
Said Mr. Stanley, of Virginia, in his speech in the House
of Representatives last March, speaking of a certain class of
Northern politicians,&mdash;"I would say, with a slight alteration
of one of Canning's verses,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Give me the avowed, erect, and manly foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Open I can meet, perhaps may turn, his blow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of all the plagues, great Heaven, thy wrath can send,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save, O, save me from a <i>dough-face friend</i>!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In closing this long letter, permit me to advert to the
opinion expressed abroad of your Fugitive Law. Mr. Webster
thought it convenient to quote the sentiment of a
nameless correspondent, as to the mischievous mixture of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
religion with politics. Possibly the opinion of Dr. Lushington,
one of the Lords of the Privy Council, Judge of the
Vice-Admiralty Court, and the negotiator, on the part of
Great Britain, of a recent treaty with France, may be entitled
to at least equal weight. This gentleman, in a
private letter to an English friend, and not intended for
publication, thus speaks of your law:&mdash;"No one can feel
more sincerely than myself, abhorrence of the Fugitive
Slave Bill,&mdash;a measure as cruel and unchristian as ever
disgraced any country." An Irish liberal, writing from
Dublin, says,&mdash;"I long looked to your country as the ark
of the world's liberties. I confess I hope for this no longer.
The Fugitive Slave Bill is a shocking sample of the depravity
of public sentiment in the United States. So atrocious
a measure could not have passed into a law, if the
majority of the people had not actively assented, or passively
consented. Here, by the preponderating influence
of our aristocracy, a small, but compact body, measures are
often carried into laws that are very distasteful to multitudes;
but such a mean, vile law as the Fugitive Slave
Bill could not pass in England."</p>

<p>The English press, Whig, Tory, and Radical, is indignant
at the atrocities of your law. The taunt of our slaveholders,
that the English had better reform abuses at home,
is thus met by a radical journal (<i>The People</i>):&mdash;"The
Americans laugh at us when we speak of American slavery,
so long as so many of our fellow-subjects in England and
Ireland are perishing from starvation through monarchical
and aristocratical tyranny. We answer, that the Americans
<i>know</i> that the men and women who lift up their
voices against American slavery are the enemies of British
tyranny and oppression."</p>

<p>Your law, Sir, degrades the national character abroad;
its excessive servility to Southern dictation excites the contempt
of the slaveholders for the easy, selfish virtue of their
Northern auxiliaries, while its outrages upon religion, justice,
humanity, and the dearest principles of personal free<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>dom,
under pretence of preserving the Union, weaken the
attachment of conscientious men for a confederacy which
requires such horrible sacrifices for its continuance. All
these evils might have been easily avoided by a law satisfying
every requirement of the Constitution, and yet treating
the alleged fugitive as a <span class="smcap">MAN</span>, and granting him the
same protection as is accorded to an alleged murderer.
God gave you, Sir, an opportunity for which you ought to
have been grateful, of illustrating your Puritan descent by
standing forth before the nation as an advocate of justice
and freedom, and of the rights of the poor and oppressed.
Through a blind devotion to a political leader, you rejected
the palm which Providence tendered to your acceptance,
and have indelibly associated your name with cruelty and
injustice. Had you retired from the notice of the public,
as you did from the suffrages of the electors, you had acted
wisely. In an evil hour for yourself, you stood forth as
the champion of the Fugitive Slave Law. Its enemies rejoice
in your rashness, for your feeble apology has rendered
its deformities more prominent, and, by failing to vindicate,
you have virtually confessed its abominations. May you
live, Sir, to deplore the grievous error you have committed,
and, by your future efforts in behalf of human freedom and
happiness, atone for the wound they have received at your
hands.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> See report in the <i>New York Tribune</i>, 25th December, 1850.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>In one of the most celebrated of these sermons, we find the
following broad assertion:&mdash;"If God <i>has</i> left to men the choice of the
<i>kind</i> of government they will have, he has <i>not</i> left it to their
choice whether they will obey human government or not. He has
<i>commanded</i> that obedience." Our rulers command us, when required by a
commissioner's agent, to aid in hunting and seizing our innocent
fellow-men, and delivering them into the hands of their task-masters.
That the reverend preacher would render a cheerful obedience to such a
mandate, there is little doubt. We read that the Jewish rulers, "The
chief priests and Pharisees, had given a <i>commandment</i>, that, if any one
knew where he (Jesus) was, he should show it, that they might take him."
Strange is it, that of the college of Apostles there was but one "good
citizen," who rendered obedience to the powers ordained by God; all the
others suffered death for their wilful, deliberate defiance of the laws
and the magistrates of the land. As a specimen of the teaching of these
cotton divines, I quote from this same admired sermon the following
precious piece of information, viz.:&mdash;"Nor is it true that the <i>fugitive
slave</i> is made an <i>outlaw</i>, and on that ground justifiable for bloody
and murderous resistance of law. He is under <i>the protection of law</i>;
and if any man injures him, or kills him, the law will avenge him, just
<i>as soon as it would you or me</i>." To deny the truth of this solemn
declaration, made in the house of God, would be, in the reverend
gentleman's estimation, but a portion of "that perpetual abuse of our
Southern brethren" of which he complains. He must, however, permit us to
call his attention to the following advertisements respecting a <span class="smcap">FUGITIVE
SLAVE</span>, published in the Wilmington Journal of the 18th of October last,
in pursuance of a law of the State of North Carolina.</p>

<p>"<i>State of North Carolina, New Hanover County.</i>&mdash;Whereas complaint upon
oath hath this day been made to us, two of the justice of the peace for
the State and County aforesaid, by Guilford Horn, of Edgecombe County,
that a certain male slave belonging to him, named <span class="smcap">Harry</span>,&mdash;a carpenter by
trade, about 40 years old, 5 feet 5 inches high, or thereabouts, yellow
complexion, stout built, with a scar on his left leg (from the cut of an
axe), has very thick lips, eyes deep sunk in his head, forehead very
square, tolerably loud voice, has lost one or two of his upper teeth,
and has a very dark spot on his jaw, supposed to be a mark,&mdash;hath
<i>absented</i> himself from his master's service, and is <i>supposed</i> to be
lurking about in this County, committing acts of felony or other
misdeeds: These are, therefore, in the name of the State aforesaid, to
command said slave forthwith to surrender himself, and return home to
his master; and we do hereby, by virtue of the act of Assembly in such
case made and provided, intimate and declare that if the said slave
Harry doth not surrender himself, and return home immediately after the
publication of these presents, that any person or persons may <span class="smcap">KILL</span> and
<span class="smcap">DESTROY</span> the said slave by such means as he may think fit, without
accusation or impeachment of any crime or offence for so doing, and
without incurring any penalty or forfeiture thereby.

"<span class="smcap">One hundred and twenty-five dollars reward</span> will be paid for the
delivery of said <span class="smcap">Harry</span> to me at Tonsott Depot, Edgecombe County, or for
his confinement in any jail in the State, so that I can get him; or one
hundred and fifty dollars will be given for his <span class="smcap">Head</span>. He was lately
heard from in Newbern, where he called himself Henry Barnes (or Burns)
and will be likely to continue the name or assume that of Coppage or
Farmer. He has a free mulatto woman for a wife, by the name of Sally
Bozeman, who has lately removed to Wilmington, and lives in that part of
the town called Texas, where he will likely be lurking.
